# react4s-example
An example of React4s: Search in Spotify artists.

This example project features:

  - Ajax with proper loading and errors
  - Debounced input field (to avoid making too many API requests)
  - CSS transitions

# Disclaimer
I am in no way affiliated with Spotify - this example just uses their open API.
