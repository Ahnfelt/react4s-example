# React4s Example
Search in Spotify artists. A small example of an [React4s](https://github.com/Ahnfelt/react4s) application.

This example project features:

  - Ajax with proper loading and errors
  - Debounced input field (to avoid making too many API requests)
  - CSS transitions

# Disclaimer
I am in no way affiliated with Spotify - this example just uses their open API.
