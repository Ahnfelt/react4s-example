# React4s Example
Search in Spotify artists. A small example of a [React4s](https://github.com/Ahnfelt/react4s) application.

# Online demo

http://ting.ahnfelt.dk/react4s/spotify/

# Features

  - Ajax with proper loading and errors
  - Debounced input field (to avoid making too many API requests)
  - CSS transitions

# Disclaimer

I am in no way affiliated with Spotify - this example just uses their open API.
